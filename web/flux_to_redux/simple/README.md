# Simple Flux To Redux Example

This example illustrates the differences between a Flux, Influx, and Redux implementation of the same app. For more 
information on transitioning and the steps required, see the [Flux to Redux guide](../../../doc/flux_to_redux.md).

For specific code examples, especially refactoring from Flux to `connect` or `connectFlux` components, see the 
influx_implementation specifically.
