# OverReact Analyzer Plugin

> A [Dart analyzer plugin][analyzer_plugin] for OverReact


## Try it in your package!
1. Add over_react to your pubspec.yaml

    __If you wish to develop the plugin locally, see [this section](#local-development).__
    
1. Enable the plugin in your analysis_options.yaml:
    ```yaml
    analyzer:
      plugins:
        over_react
    ```
1. Restart the Dart Analysis Server in your IDE
   
## Repo Structure

See the [analyzer_plugin package structure documentation][analyzer_plugin_package_structure] for terminology and more info.

- _over_react_: the "host" package
- _over_react_analyzer_plugin_ (`over_react/tools/analyzer_plugin`) - the "boostrap" and "plugin" packages, merged
        
    We decided to merge these packages since it allows us to avoid creating a separate package for the plugin, which would have resulted in a more painful dev/release experience. (Since the plugin depends on over_react, we'd want to use monorepo to manage the packages. However, we can't do that currently, due to internal tooling restrictions that prevent us from having multiple packages declared in a single repository.)
        
- _playground_ - (`over_react/tools/analyzer_plugin/playground`) - a "target" package that consumes the plugin, useful for manually testing plugin during development 
        
## Local Development

See [analyzer_plugin's tutorial][analyzer_plugin_tutorial] on building a plugin for general information on developing a Dart analyzer plugin.

### Setup

**Before you do anything:** run 
```sh
dart tool/init_local_dev.dart
```

Normally, the Dart Analysis Server does a one-time copy of plugin code into the Dart Analysis Server state folder (usually `~/.dartServer/.plugin_manager`), and never updates for plugins derived from path dependencies (TODO make dart-lang issue for this). 

This means, normally, ___any changes you make to the plugin will not be reflected___.

This script sets up a symlink to point to the original plugin directory (replacing any copy if it exists), so that changes are always reflected.  

### Development cycle
1. Make changes to the plugin within the _over_react_analyzer_plugin_ directory
1. In the _playground_ directory or in [another package you've pulled the plugin into](#pulling-in-a-local-version-of-the-plugin), restart the Analysis Server
1. Wait for the Analysis Server to boot up, analyze, and run your updated plugin code    

### Debugging the Plugin
The dev experience when working on this plugin isn't ideal (See the `analyzer_plugin` debugging docs [for more information](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/pkg/analyzer_plugin/doc/tutorial/debugging.md)), but it's possible debug and see logs from the plugin.

These instructions are currently for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, etc.) only.

Before starting, ensure you have the `analyzer_plugin` open as it's own project (rather than opening `over_react`) in your IDE.

1. Ensure your Dart version is at least `2.8.3`. (The protocol connection was made available somewhere around this version)

1. In your project, create a new Run Configuration using the `Dart Remote Debug` template
    
    ![](doc/create-configuration-1.png) 
    
    ![](doc/create-configuration-2.png) 
    
1. Ensure the "Search sources in" section is pointing to the plugin package directory. Save your new Configuration. We'll come back to it later.
    
    ![](doc/create-configuration-3.png) 

1. Open the "Registry" using the command palette (<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>)

    ![](doc/open-jetbrains-registry.png)
    
1. Find the `dart.server.vm.options` key and set the value to `--observe=0` (allows access to the Observatory on a random, non-allocated port)

    ![](doc/edit-jetbrains-registry.png) 
            
1. Next, we need to open the analyzer diagnostics to find the URL for our debugger. Open the Dart Analaysis Server Settings, and click `View analyzer diagnostics`. This will open your browser.
    ![](doc/open-analyzer-diagnostics.gif) 

1. In the Analysis Server Diagnostics page in your browser, click the `Memory and CPU Usage` tab. Copy the protocol connection URL.
    ![](doc/find-the-port.png)
  
1. Run your newly created configuration by selecting it and clicking the "Debug" button
    
    ![](doc/run-configuration-1.png)
    
1. Finally, when prompted, paste the URL you just copied and click `OK`.
    ![](doc/run-configuration-2.png)

1. In the debugger tab that was opened, verify that the debugger connected.
    
    ![](doc/verify-connected.png)
    
Congrats, you're debugging! ðŸŽ‰

You can now set breakpoints, view logs, and do everything else you'd normally do in the debugger for.

### Documenting Lints / Assists

__All lints and assists should be documented!!!__

Documentation for the lints / assists provided by the analyzer plugin are published to <https://workiva.github.io/over_react/analyzer_plugin/>.

This is accomplished by placing a `@DocsMeta` annotation on a `DiagnosticCode` for lints, and an `AssistKind` for assists. In order for them to work properly, the property the `DiagnosticCode` or `AssistKind` is assigned to __must be a `const`__ as shown in the examples below.

#### Examples

__Error Example:__
````dart
const _desc = r'Do not use string CSS property values without specifying a unit.';
const _correction =
    r'Use CSS property values that are strings _with_ units, or numbers _(in which case `px` will be inferred)_.';
// <editor-fold desc="Documentation Details">
const _details = '''

**ALWAYS** $_correction

**GOOD:**
```
@override
render() {
  return (Dom.div()..style = {'width': 80})(
    'I am eighty pixels wide!',
  );
}
```

**GOOD:**
```
@override
render() {
  return (Dom.div()..style = {'width': '80px'})(
    'I am also eighty pixels wide!',
  );
}
```

**BAD:**
```
@override
render() {
  return (Dom.div()..style = {'width': '80'})(
    'I never rendered because of a ReactJS runtime error :(',
  );
}
```

''';
// </editor-fold>

class StyleMissingUnitDiagnostic extends ComponentUsageDiagnosticContributor {
  @DocsMeta(_desc, details: _details)
  static const code = DiagnosticCode(
    'over_react_style_missing_unit',
    _desc,
    AnalysisErrorSeverity.ERROR,
    AnalysisErrorType.SYNTACTIC_ERROR,
    correction: _correction,
  );

  // ...
}
````

__Lint / Warning Example:__
````dart
const _desc = r'Avoid forwarding custom props to a Dom builder.';
// <editor-fold desc="Documentation Details">
const _details = r'''

**PREFER** to use `addUnconsumedDomProps` instead of `addUnconsumedProps` on Dom builders.

**GOOD:**
```
@override
render() {
  return (Dom.div()
    ..modifyProps(addUnconsumedDomProps)
    ..id = 'foo'
  )(props.children);
}
```

**BAD:**
```
@override
render() {
  return (Dom.div()
    ..modifyProps(addUnconsumedProps)
    ..id = 'foo'
  )(props.children);
}
```

''';
// </editor-fold>

class ForwardOnlyDomPropsToDomBuildersDiagnostic extends ComponentUsageDiagnosticContributor {
  @DocsMeta(_desc, details: _details)
  static const code = DiagnosticCode(
    'over_react_forward_only_dom_props_to_dom_builders',
    _desc,
    AnalysisErrorSeverity.WARNING,
    AnalysisErrorType.STATIC_WARNING,
    correction: 'Use addUnconsumedDomProps instead of addUnconsumedProps.',
  );

  // ...
}
````


#### Best Practices
1. The value of `DiagnosticCode.name` should always start with `over_react_`.
1. The value of `DiagnosticCode.message` and `DocsMeta.description` should use consistent terminology based on the severity of the lint.
    * `AnalysisErrorSeverity.INFO`s and `AnalysisErrorSeverity.WARNING`s should start with _"Avoid"_ or _"Prefer"_.
    * `AnalysisErrorSeverity.ERROR`s should start with _"Do not"_, _"Never"_ or _"Always"_.
    
    Check out the [examples](#examples) above for demonstrations of this.
1. The value of `DiagnosticCode.message` should not include the steps that users should take to correct the lint.
    * Use `DiagnosticCode.correction` for this as shown in the [examples](#examples) above.
1. The value of `DiagnosticCode.message` and `DiagnosticCode.correction` should always end with a period.
    * Use `DiagnosticCode.correction` for this as shown in the [examples](#examples) above.
1. When possible, the value of `DocsMeta.description` _(first argument passed to the `@DocsMeta` annotation)_ should match the value of `DiagnosticCode.message`.
    * Sometimes this isn't possible as a result of using `errorMessageArgs` to pass dynamic information into the message.
1. The value of `DocsMeta.details` gets parsed as markdown, and should provide as much detail about the lint as possible - including a "GOOD" and "BAD" example when possible _(as shown in the [examples](#examples) above)_.

 

#### Updating Published Documentation
1. When a new/updated lint or assist merges to master, merge master into the `gh-pages` branch _(it should merge cleanly)_.
1. From the `tools/analyzer_plugin/` directory, run:
    ```shell script
    dart ./tool/doc.dart --gh-pages
    ```
1. Commit the changes, and push them to the `gh-pages` branch.
    This will deploy the updated documentation to <https://workiva.github.io/over_react/analyzer_plugin/> - typically within a matter of seconds.
